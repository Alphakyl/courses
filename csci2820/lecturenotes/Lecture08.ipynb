    "So far we've talked about the solution to $A\\bx = {\\bf b}$ in a couple of different ways.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Sol exists if ${\\bf b}$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$\n",
    "* Sol exists if $A$ is square and nonsingular\n",
    "* Sol exists if $A$ is square and elimination produces a pivot in ever row\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we start to look at the solvability of $A\\bx = {\\bf b}$ from a much richer perspective, and we also relax the assumption that $A$ must be square. In order to do this we must learn about the new concepts of vector spaces and subspaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "###Vector Spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially a vector space is a set of vectors that satisfy some very specific properties and axioms.  In general, arithmetic in a vector space must satisfy the usual arithmetic properties: commutativity of addition, associativity of addition, distribution laws, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these things there are two very important rules that a collection of vectors must satisfy in order to be a vector space: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **closure under vector addition**: If vectors ${\\bf u}$ and ${\\bf v}$ are in the space, then so is ${\\bf u} + {\\bf v}$\n",
    "2. **closure under scalar multiplcation**: If ${\\bf u}$ is in the space then so is $c{\\bf u}$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Notice that closure under scalar multiplication automatically assumes that the zero vector is in the space (since we could multiply a vector by 0), but this is such a useful rule on it's own for checking that a set of vectors is a vector space that we give it honorary rule status $~~~~~~~~~~~$\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **contains the zero vector**: The zero vector ${\\bf 0}$ is in the space\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer brevity instead of verbosity then both of the closure rules can be combined into one by saying that any linear combinations of two vectors are in the space. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **closure under linear combination**: If vectors ${\\bf u}$ and $\\bv$ are in the space then so is $c\\bu + d\\bv$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen several vector spaces this semester.  The most important one for us is the space of all $n$-length vectors with real values.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: The space of all real vectors of length $n$ is $\\mathbb{R}^n$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that $\\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies all of the usual rules of vector arithmetic.  To see that it satisfies the closure rules we note that: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you add two $n$-length vectors you get an $n$-length vector back \n",
    "2. If you multiply an $n$-length vector by a scalar you get an $n$-length vector back.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important vector space is the space of all $n$-length complex-valued vector spaces: $\\mathbb{C}^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other things can be vector spaces too. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: $\\mathbb{M}_{2\\times 2}$ is the space of all real $2 \\times 2$ matrices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you add two $2 \\times 2$ matrices together, or multiply a $2 \\times 2$ matrix by a scalar, you get back a $2 \\times 2$ matrix.  Furthermore the zero \"vector\" in this space is the $2 \\times 2$ matrix of all zeros. \n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so vector spaces are important.  They're the setting in which all linear algebra takes place.  But even more interesting are what are called **subspaces** of a vector space.  A subspace is a vector space *inside* another vector space. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: A subspace of a vector space is a set of vectors (including ${\\bf 0}$) that satisfies the rules of being a vector space.  Let $S$ be a set inside of a vector space, then if $\\bu$ and $\\bv$ are in $S$\n",

The two reduced forms $U$ and $R$ corresponding to $A$ have special names.  The matrix $U$ is called the **echelon form** of $A$ or sometimes the **upper echelon form** of $A$.  The matrix $R$ is called the **reduced row echelon form** of $A$. \n",
