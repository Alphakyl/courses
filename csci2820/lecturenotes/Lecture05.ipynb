It is the first practical implementation of Gaussian Elimination that we've seen in the course that is actually used in computer science practice.  Along the way we're going to introduce the concept of the matrix **inverse**.

    "\n",
    "Now we'll look at a shorthand method for computing the LU Decomposition of a matrix that is derived from the actual computer implementation.  To motivate this, let's think about how many pieces of data we actually need to store for the LU Decomposition process. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think about the 3x3 matrix case from the previous example.  The original matrix contains 9 floating point values.  If we compute the LU Decomposition and store each of these in separate matrices, that's an additional 18 floating point values that need to be stored.  Now, scale that up to a large problem of size NxN. If N is very large, then storing L and U separately requires **twice** the cost of storage for the original matrix $A$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can reduce this number by being a little bit clever.  We know that after elimination the matrices L and U are lower and upper triangular, respectively.  That means that roughly half of the entries in the result are zero.  Since we know this, and in particular, we know where these zeros are, there's **no point in storing them**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we know that the main diagonal entries of L are all 1's.  Again, because we know what they are and where they are, there's no need to store them.  This means that for the 3x3 matrix we have 6 entries that we need to store for U and 3 entries that we need to store for L.  That gives 6+3=9 entires that we need to store. \n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so we've gotten the storage down to the same amount of data as the original matrix, but we can do even better that.  If our goal is to solve linear systems of the form $A\\bx = {\\bf b}$ for either one or multiple rhs vectors, then once we've computed the LU Decomposition of $A$, we no longer need the original matrix. So... we'll store the LU Decomposition **in-place** over the matrix $A$.  \n",
